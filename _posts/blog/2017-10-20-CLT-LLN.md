This post is about some understandings of the Central Limit Theorem and (un)related stuff.
First of all, a very good lecture [Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110](https://youtu.be/OprNqnHsVIA).

## Law of Large Numbers
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers),
\\[ \bar{x}_n-\mu \rightarrow 0\\]
LLN says that the sample average converges to the expected value as \\(n\\) approaches infinity. But that doesn't tell how fast it converges.

## Central Limit Theorem
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem),
\\[ \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}_n-\mu) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)\\]
CLT says that as \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the random variable \\( \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}_n-\mu) \\) converges in distribution to a normal \\( N(0,\sigma^2) \\).

The interesting part is the scaling factor \\( \sqrt{n} \\),
for a smaller scaling factor the whole term \\( \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}_n-\mu) \\) always goes to zero,
for a larger scaling factor the term will blow up, only for \\( \sqrt{n} \\) it converges to a distribution with constant variance.

For instance, for \\(n\\) i.i.d variables with zero mean, as \\(n\\) gets larger, their mean goes to zero (LLN), their sum blows up to positive/negative infinity, but this term \\( \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}_n-\mu) \\) converges in distribution to a normal.

CTL is useful in many areas including [the Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk),
which is often used to model the stock price, see [this blog](http://epchan.blogspot.jp/2016/04/mean-reversion-momentum-and-volatility.html) and [this question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/308545/95569).
