This post is about some understandings of the Central Limit Theorem and (un)related stuff. 

## Central Limit Theorem
As defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), its basic form is
\\[ \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)\\]
saying that as \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the random variable \\( \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \\) converges in distribution to a normal \\( N(0,\sigma^2) \\).

The interesting part is the scaling factor \\( \sqrt{n} \\),
for a smaller scaling factor the whole term \\( \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \\) always goes to zero,
for a larger scaling factor the term will blow up, only for \\( \sqrt{n} \\) it converges to a distribution with constant variance.

It can be proved using the fact convergence of [moment-generating functions (MGFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function) implies the convergence in distribution,
i.e. to prove \\( M(\sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu)/\sigma) = M(N(0,1))\\). 
Here's a very good lecture on that [Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110](https://youtu.be/OprNqnHsVIA).

So we know for \\(n\\) i.i.d variables with zero mean, as \\(n\\) gets larger, its mean goes to zero (the law of large numbers), its sum blows up to positive/negative infinity, but this term \\( \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \\) converges in distribution to a normal.

CTL is useful in many areas including [the Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk),
which is often used to model the stock price, see [this blog](http://epchan.blogspot.jp/2016/04/mean-reversion-momentum-and-volatility.html) and [this question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/308545/95569).

## Variance of Sum of IID Random Variables
The \\( \sqrt{n} \\) scaling factor also applies when summing a finite number of i.i.d random variables (ref: [sum of uncorrelated variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Sum_of_uncorrelated_variables_(Bienaym%C3%A9_formula))). For example [sum of normally distributed random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variables), and [Irwin–Hall distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin%E2%80%93Hall_distribution).

Note that this is different from applying a change of variable \\(z=2x\\), which gives a variance of \\((2\sigma)^2\\) instead of \\(2\sigma^2\\).

For \\(n\\) normally distributed random variables with the same variance, it follows
\\(\sum (x_n-\mu_n) \sim N(0, n\sigma^2)\\), which is equivalent to 
\\[ \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\\]
the Central Limit Theorem.

## Sampling Normal Distributions
Using the facts above we can approximate samples from any normal distribution given samples from a uniform distribution \\(U(0,1)\\) (though in fact Box–Muller transform can do that accurately).

According to Central Limit Theorem, the sum of \\(n\\) uniformly distributed variables approximately follows a normal distribution, \\(\sum x \sim N(n/2,\sigma^2)\\). According to [sum of uncorrelated variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Sum_of_uncorrelated_variables_(Bienaym%C3%A9_formula)), we can work out the variance \\(\sigma^2 = nVar(x)=n/12\\), therefore \\(\sqrt{n}(\sum x/n-1/2)\\) converges in distribution to \\( N(0,1/12) \\).
